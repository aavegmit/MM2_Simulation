I have successfully emulated a M/M/2 queue using pthreads.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILES:

My Warmup Project 2 has a total of six files, namely:
-arivalThread.cc
-main.cc
-main.h
-serverThread.cc
-Makefile
-README

arivalThread.cc - Creates new customer and inserts them in the Q. To perform this, it first acquires the lock and push the customer object in the Q. Once it inserts a customer, the Server is signalled

serverThread.cc - Waits on a condition variable until the arrival thread signals on it. On receiveing a signal, server pops out a customer from the Queue and serves him for the specific time.

main.cc - It has all the command line parsing code and calls the respective methods

The time for which arrival thread or the servers sleeps is obtained from three methods
	- Exponential distribution
	- Deterministic distribution
	- From a tracefile

To make the execuatble the graders need to run " make " to create the executables.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESIGN DECISIONS :


1) The main function invokes two kinds of threads i.e. arrival threads, and the Server thread(s)

2) The main thread catches the SIGINT signal and sets a global flag. The arrival thread checks this flag before producing any new customer. The server thread(s) checks this flag after waking up from the condition variable.

3) If the server is already serving a customer when the signal is generated, it continues to serve this customer and after serving it shutdowns.

REFERENCE:

1) I have used bits of code for threads synchronization from Wrox publications. I have explicitly mentioned this as comments in the code.

2) I have used the Makefile from my CS531 course.
